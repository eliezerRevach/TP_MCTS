# Thesis Summary and Algorithms

Reference: `docs/Temporal_Planning___IJCAI25_Camera_Ready-2.txt`

## Problem Setting
- Plan online in stochastic domains with durative, concurrent actions and deadlines.
- Model used in the paper: CoMDP+ (extends fMDP/CoMDP with start/end effects, overall/end conditions, deadline constraints).
- Objective in the paper baseline: maximize probability of reaching goal before deadline.

## Main Algorithms/Techniques to Keep in Mind
- **TP-MCTS**: online MCTS-based planner that decides both *which* action and *when* to dispatch it.
- **Offline compilation**: split each durative action into `start/end` snap actions and track execution with `InExecution(a)` fluents.
- **Temporal reasoning**: maintain an STN per branch; enforce action ordering and duration constraints through STN updates.
- **Evaluation heuristic (PTRPG)**: probabilistic temporal relaxed planning graph estimate used instead of standard rollouts.
- **Backprop variants**:
  - `earliest`: scalar value backup + earliest feasible scheduling.
  - `root-interval`: value function over root execution times, using feasible root-time intervals from leaf STNs.
- **Baselines in paper**: MW-RTDP and MW-MCTS (from Mausam & Weld formulation).

## Report/Writeup Expectations for This Project
- Explain design choices relative to TP-MCTS components: search, scheduling, heuristic, and temporal constraints.
- Separate what is inherited from the paper vs what is newly proposed/modified in this thesis continuation.
- When discussing results, include both success behavior and deadline/temporal-feasibility effects, not only goal reachability.
