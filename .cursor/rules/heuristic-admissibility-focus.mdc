# Heuristic Admissibility Focus

This project's main direction is to study and improve **heuristic admissibility** under deadlines, while also examining "admissible on average" behavior with explicit guarantees.

## Core Research Priorities
- Shift framing from pure reachability to reward maximization under deadline (reachability is a special case reward).
- For every heuristic claim, state clearly:
  - whether it is admissible, inadmissible, or only admissible in expectation;
  - what guarantee is provided (worst-case bound, confidence bound, or none).
- Prefer conservative lower-bound reasoning when claiming admissibility.

## Mandatory Bias Check: m-Doors Family
- Use the m-doors setting as a recurring sanity check for heuristic bias.
- Known failure mode to track:
  - A biased heuristic may suggest "collect all keys once, then move `n` steps".
  - Real cost can behave like about `2*m*n` because each door may require returning for a different key.
- Any heuristic update must be tested against this pattern and similar "poly(m) gap" constructions.

## Evaluation Discipline
- Include counterexamples where heuristic guidance looks good locally but is globally misleading.
- If using average-case calibration, report confidence/variance and failure probability on adversarial structures (like m-doors).
- Do not present average performance as admissibility unless a formal bound is given.
